 A mixture of British and African influences, Anguillian culture is imbued with signs of its complex history. Important stages and events from their historical past are celebrated with gusto. Legends, stories and celebrations revolve around the early Amerindian settlements, European settlers, and the African slaves who were imported to work on plantations. These are woven into everyday life and passed on through the generations.

SourceThe spectacular Summer Carnival is perhaps the most important such tradition. The festival, which takes place in August, celebrates the emancipation of African slaves on Anguilla. It starts with an early morning jam and runs for a fortnight. The streets are filled with people including dancers, stilt-walkers and other revelers. The days are packed with beach picnics and sailboat racing while the evenings are vibrant with dancing, competitions, fairs, costumes and parades.

Sailboat racing is the national sport of Anguilla. Racing events are much celebrated and tourists and locals throng the island shores to watch and cheer. The people of Anguilla are warm and friendly and know how to take joy in the good things of life like unique cuisine, rum, music and dancing.

In 1993, the Anguilla National Trust (ANT) was established in order to preserve the island's heritage, natural resources, and culture so that they may be preserved for future generations. ANT initiates and runs programs to maintain Anguilla's natural environment and archaeological sites, which are also a central part of the land's culture.
