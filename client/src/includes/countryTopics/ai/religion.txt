 The original inhabitants of Anguilla, the Arawak Indians, practiced their own religion based on beliefs about the sun, moon, and two large caverns located on the island, where they believed humans came from. To this day, evidences of such practices in the form of petroglyphs and offering bowls can be found on the island.

In the present day, Anguilla’s twelve thousand-strong populace mostly practices Christianity and churches dot the island. The majority are Anglican (40%), closely followed by the Methodists (33%). Roman Catholic (15%), Adventists (7%) and Baptists (5%) make up the rest of the population.

Anguilla is also the birthplace of Robert Athlyi Rogers, author of The Holy Piby, an important book on Rastafarian beliefs. Today, there are many ‘rastas’ living on the island and the influence of the religion spreads even to those who are not members.
