 Argentina’s culture is a mixture of many traditions.

The country’s art, its festivals, the food, language and music are a reflection of the people who have inhabited the country from long ago. They are the native Argentineans who have lived in the country thousands of years, and the immigrants from Europe, the Middle East, Asia and other parts of South America in the last 500 years.

Music

Music is always present in Argentina, in the homes and in the streets.

Musical performances are a part of every festivity and celebration.

All through Argentina, you will find different types of music. The music of their folklore brings together the Native Argentineans and the Spanish music with the music of another Latin country and Africa.

The classic European music and rock are also popular in Argentina.

The most popular musical instrument is the bandoneon.

A bandoneon is similar to a small accordion. The difference is that instead of large keys it has small buttons on both sides that are touched to create musical notes.

The best-known art of Argentina is the Tango. It is not only a dance style, but is also a music style. It was invented at La Boca about 100 years ago.
