 Australia formally known as the Commonwealth of Australia is a nation made up of the mainland of the Australian Continent, Tasmania Island, and many other smaller islands. It is the sixth biggest state by total area in the world and it is bordered by East Timor, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to the north, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to the north-east, and New Zealand to the south-east. Its capital city is Canberra and Sydney is the largest urban city in the country.

The history of Australia goes back to more than 60,000 years when the country was first inhabited. Some of the key historical events during this period to the present will be discussed in brief below.
Aboriginal Australia

The first people to arrive in what we now know as Australia were the Torres Strait Islanders and the Australian Aborigines. The Aborigines came by boat from the islands of what is currently Indonesia and they resided in all regions of Australia. They led a very simple life and they survived on hunting, gathering, and fishing, and did not farm. The Aborigines devised tools such as the spear and boomerang. Tradition was very significant in their lives and they practised a religion called Dreaming which had a lot of stories about how spirits created the world. About 30,000 years ago is when Aboriginal art began and there are a lot of stories cut in rocks and painted on walls all around the country.

During this era, a number of European explorers explored the territory. Some of them included Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon (1606), Dutchman Abel Tasman (1642 and 1644), and Englishman William Dampier (1688). None of them was, however, interested in laying claim to the land. It was in 1770 when a Captain James Cook, a British Sailor, found the lush east coast of Australia, named it New South Wales and claimed it for Britain.

By 1788, the Aboriginals existed as 250 distinct nations. Most of them had alliances with each other and in every nation, there were a number of clans, from as few as five to as many as 40. Every nation had its own dialect and some had a few, thus more than 250 languages were spoken, roughly 200 of which are currently extinct. It was in this same year when permanent settlers from Europe arrived in Sydney and they came to control the majority of the continent towards the end of the 19th century.

The region acquired the name Australia for the first time in 1814 when Englishman Matthew Flinders drew his map of the coast. The name was later officially embraced by the authorities.
Colonial Australia

Captain Cook had already claimed Australia for Britain and the British made a decision to use the region as a prison colony; it required a place to send people who had been jailed for theft and other crimes since its prisons were full and it had lost its American colonies in the American War of Independence. In 1788, Arthur Philip, the first Governor of New South Wales, led the British First Fleet of 11 ships to Sydney. Each ship carried about 1500 people and roughly 160,000 prisoners were brought to Australia from 1788 to 1868. Free emigrants started arriving in the 1790s.

In the first few years, the European settlers were faced with a shortage of food but they started farming and more people arrived. Wool was the main crop being planted and it brought good money. Sydney developed and new cities began to emerge and by 1822, a lot of cities of had been developed.

Matthew Flinders and George Bass sailed to Tasmania and began a colony at Hobart in 1803. William Hovell and Hamilton Hume moved south and found good land in Victoria and the Murray River. Thomas Mitchell moved inland and discovered more rivers. In 1826, the first British military station was established at King George Sound in Western Australia. In 1829, the Swan River Colony was established, with towns at Perth and Fremantle. In 1836, a free-settler protectorate was established in South Australia and no prisoners were ever sent there. In 1859, Queensland became a separate colony. Farms and towns spread across the country and as a result, the Aborigines were forced to move from their land. Some of them were killed, while others died from hunger and illness. The Aboriginal people were soon outnumbered by the settlers, forcing them to settle on reserves.

The people in Australia wanted to govern their own country, and not get orders from London. The governors were elected by London and soon the settlers started demanding for more democracy and a local government. As a result, the New South Wales Legislative Council was established in 1825 to give advice to the Governor of New South Wales. In 1835, William Wentworth formed the Australian Patriotic Association to demand a democratic government for New South Wales. This was the first political party in the country. In 1840, the Sydney City Council and the Adelaide City Council were developed and a certain group of people, those with a specific amount of money, could vote for them. In 1843, the country’s first parliamentary elections were held for the New South Wales Legislative Council. The Australian Colonies Government Act of 1850 allowed constitutions for Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales.

In 1855, London granted partial self government to Tasmania, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. The right to vote was also granted to men above 21 years old in South Australia. A year later, a new secret ballot was introduced in South Australia, Victoria and Victoria. This allowed the citizens to vote privately.

The six states of Australia became a country under a single constitution on 1 January 1901. The country came to be known as the Commonwealth of Australia through a Federal Constitution declared by Lord Hopetoun, the Governor-General.
World War I and World War II in Australia

As a previous colony of Britain, Australia supported its mother country during WWI but it experienced a lot of devastating effects. More than 400,000 locals volunteered to join the war and roughly 60,000 of them lost their lives, and many others were wounded. After the war came the Great Depression in 1929 and the economic and social divisions broadened and a lot of financial institutions in the country fell.

Australia also took part in WWII and contributed greatly to the allied victory in the Pacific, Asia and Europe. The war saw a number of occupations open to women and the number of employed women grew rapidly. When the war came to an end in 1945, a lot of emigrants from the Middle East and Europe moved to Australia, and most of them were able to secure jobs in the flourishing manufacturing sector.

The country’s cultural diversity, resistance to the Vietnam War, and increasing sovereignty from Britain, all contributed to an atmosphere of social, political, and economic change.

In 1967, the locals voted in a countrywide referendum to allow the federal government create policies on behalf of the Aboriginal Australians and include them in future censuses.

In 1972, the Australian Labour Party under Gough Whitlam was selected to power, bringing to an end the post-war authority of the Liberal and Country Party Coalition. Over the three years that followed, the new government introduced free global healthcare, ended conscription, adopted multi-culturalism, abolished university fees, abandoned the White Australia rule, and introduced equal remuneration for women and no-fault divorce. In 1975 scandal and inflation led to the dismissal of the government by the Governor-General and in a general election that followed, the Labour Party was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition which was in power until 1983.
Australia, after the 70s

Between 1983 and 1996, several economic reforms were introduced, for instance, floating the Australian dollar and deregulating the banking system. In 1996, a Coalition Government under John Howard won the general elections and was elected again in 1998, 2001, and 2004. The Government implemented a number of reforms, including changes in the industrial relations and taxation systems.

In 2007, the Labour Party under Kevin Rudd was selected with a plan to change the country’s industrial relations system, enforce a countrywide curriculum in education, and reduce greenhouse emissions. Three years later, Julia Gillard challenged Rudd and became the first female Prime Minister of Australia.

The New Coalition Government led by Tony Abbott was sworn in, in 2013. Abbott was, however, defeated by Malcolm Turnbull in a leadership ballot in 2015. Turnbull was elected again in a general election in July 2016.

Australia currently has the globe’s 13th biggest economy and the 9th highest per capita income. It also ranks highly in education, health, political rights, quality of life, civil liberties, and economic freedom. Australia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G20, ANZUS, World Trade Organization, the Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
