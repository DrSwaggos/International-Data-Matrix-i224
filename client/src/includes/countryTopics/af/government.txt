 The government of Afghanistan is an Islamic republic.

The capital, Kabul, is governed by President Hamid Karzai. The rest of the country is very unstable. Although the United Nations and other organizations play a very important role in the reconstruction of the country, it is not know if it will be in Afghanistan for the long term. The new government attempts to reconstruct a country that has suffered many problems of economy, drug trafficking, militarism and the return of millions of refugees.

Since 2001, much effort has been placed in the development of strategies for national development, including the future security of Afghanistan, a strategy for the government, the growth of the economy and the reduction of the poverty.
