Afghanistan is a developing country with a mixed economy that is largely based on agriculture, forestry, and mining, as well as the production of textiles, carpets, and other goods. The country is rich in natural resources, including minerals, natural gas, and oil, which have the potential to be major drivers of economic growth. However, these resources are largely untapped due to ongoing conflicts, weak infrastructure, and a lack of investment.

Agriculture is the mainstay of the Afghan economy, accounting for about one-quarter of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Wheat, rice, corn, and other grains are the main crops, while opium poppy is also grown in some areas. Afghanistan is also home to a variety of livestock, including sheep, goats, and cattle.

Afghanistan has a small industrial sector, which includes the production of textiles, carpets, and other goods. The country's mineral resources, including copper, iron ore, and gold, have the potential to be major drivers of economic growth, but the mining sector has been hindered by insecurity and a lack of investment.

Afghanistan has a large informal sector, which includes a range of small-scale businesses and informal economic activities. This sector accounts for a significant portion of the Afghan economy, but it is not formally measured in GDP statistics. The informal sector in Afghanistan is largely unregulated and is characterized by low productivity and a lack of access to credit and other resources.

The Afghan government has made efforts to improve the business environment in the country and promote economic growth, including through the implementation of economic reforms and the establishment of a number of free economic zones. However, Afghanistan faces a number of challenges that hinder economic growth, including ongoing conflict and insecurity, a lack of infrastructure, and corruption.

Afghanistan is heavily dependent on foreign aid and international assistance, which has played a critical role in the country's economic development. The Afghan government and international organizations have made efforts to promote economic development and reduce poverty in the country, including through the implementation of development programs and the provision of financial assistance.

Overall, the economy of Afghanistan is in transition and faces a number of challenges. However, the country has a number of economic strengths and potential for growth, including a young and growing population, a rich natural resource base, and a strategic location at the crossroads of Central and South Asia.
