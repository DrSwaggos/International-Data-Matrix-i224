 The economy of Angola has depended for a long time on the few natural resources of the country.

Before the arrival of Portuguese settlers Angola exported slaves and ivory.

After the country's colonization the country's commerce changed to agricultural production, diamonds and oil. The profits from the trade did not stay in Angola, but it was transferred away by Portuguese ships. Only a small profit remained for the workers.

After Angola's independence the country was submerged in a civil war, affecting the economy adversely.

The most important sector in Angola's economy is the diamond industry.

Only three other countries in the world export more diamonds than Angola.
